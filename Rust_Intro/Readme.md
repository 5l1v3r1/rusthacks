Overview

"Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents nearly all segfaults, and guarantees thread safety." â€“ rust-lang.org
What is Rust?

Rust is:

    Fast
    Safe
    Functional
    Zero-cost

Fast

    Rust compiles to native code
    Rust has no garbage collector
    Most abstractions have zero cost
    Fine-grained control over lots of things
    Pay for exactly what you need...
    ...and pay for most of it at compile time

Safe

    No null
    No uninitialized memory
    No dangling pointers
    No double free errors
    No manual memory management!

Functional

    First-class functions
    Trait-based generics
    Algebraic datatypes
    Pattern matching

Zero-Cost 100% Safe Abstractions

    Rust's defining feature
    Strict compile-time checks remove need for runtime
    Big concept: Ownership
