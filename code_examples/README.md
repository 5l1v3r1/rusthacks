These are the examples that can be used for demonstrating the power/usage of Rust. They're up-to-date with the latest `stable` release of Rust and are actively being maintained. They're structured based on whether you need dependencies (so, `cargo`) or whether you can use `rustc` directly.

If you wanna add an example to this list, or make some changes, please feel free to open a PR! :)
